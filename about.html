            <h3>My Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
                Everyone's got an orgin, not just heroes, right? Or, maybe everyone's a hero in their own story? 
                Mine began in fifth grade when Mrs. Lallak assigned us a one page creative writing project. 
                Twenty-five notebook pages later, the story of Erik the Viking was told, and it had everything: 
                an epic romance, fierce fighting, a voyage for treasure, and of course a Norse hero named—wait for it—Erik, who won it all!

            <h3>My Writing</h3>
            <p>
                As an adult, I've been a jack-of-all trades -- a computer programmer, a project and product manager, a pilot and flight instructor, 
                a volunteer ESL and GED teacher, not to mention an avid traveler (For the long, boring version, you can check out
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-krueger-9786784" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.)
                Along the way, I've picked up some good stories, and I love to share them, most often through the lens of fantasy and science fiction.

                Ernest Hemingway said, "All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened..." 
                <br>What better way to explore truths in the world than to ask, "What if...?"

            <h3>Beyond the Page</h3>
            <p>
                When I'm not writing, I might still be behind the keyboard keeping up with the latest technology (or sneaking in a little flight or F1 simming). 
                Otherwise you can find me exploring the great outdoors by foot, small plane or even kayak. My wife and I live in Chicago, although 
                we've been known to disappear South when the sun goes into hiding.

           <h3>A Note on the Images on this Website and AI</h3>
            <p>
                As a technologist, I am fascinated by the advances in AI and the potential to advance society in ways
                we haven't yet dreamed. But as a writer, I am deeply committed to the respect of intellectual property 
                and protecting the rights of all artists. I don't use generative AI in my writing, in any capacity. That would 
                defeat its purpose for me, which is finding joy in bringing imagination to life with language. 
                Sadly, I have no such skill in pencil or pixel. 
                The images on this website were created using Apple and Adobe tools, from my own orignal prompts
                which do not reference any specific artist's style or technique. Both companies have 
                publically committed to training their AI models using their own intellectual property, royalty free sources, 
                and sources to which they have obtained legal permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we hit a disruptive change, risks and potential losers inevitably draw attention first. It helps to
                remember that technolgical advancement creates more opportunity than it destroys. Yes, things change,
                and nobody likes the ground shifting underneath them. I tend to believe this about generative AI: 
                just as painters survived the advent of the camera, 
                and instrumentalists survived audio sampling, synthesizing and recording, 
                all of which ushered in completely new forms of art and novel channels for human expression, 
                so too will illustrators, writers, musicians and other artists feeling in the
                generative crosshairs continue to thrive. Human creativity and talent will always have a market, because
                they inspire us and connect us to kindred human experience, even while AI and future technologies 
                create new mediums and channels for new generations of artists to create and express themselves.
