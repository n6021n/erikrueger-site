            <h3>My Origin Story</h3>
            <p>
                Everyone's got an origin, not just heroes, right? Or, maybe everyone's a hero in their own story? 
                Mine began in fifth grade when Mrs. Lallak assigned us a one page creative writing project. 
                Twenty-five notebook pages later, the story of Erik the Viking was told, and it had everything: 
                an epic romance, fierce fighting, a voyage for treasure, and of course a Norse hero named—wait for it—Erik, who won it all!
        
            </p>

            <h3>My Writing</h3>
            <p>
                As an adult, I've been a jack-of-all trades -- a computer programmer, a project and product manager, a pilot and flight instructor, 
                a volunteer ESL and GED teacher, not to mention an avid traveler (For the long, boring version, you can check out
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-krueger-9786784" target="_blank">my LinkedIn profile</a>.)
                Along the way, I've picked up some good stories, and I love to share them, most often through the lens of fantasy and science fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ernest Hemingway said, "All good books are alike in that they are truer than if they had really happened..." 
                <br>What better way to explore truths in the world than to ask, "What if...?"
            </p>

            <h3>Beyond the Page</h3>
            <p>
                When I'm not writing, I might still be behind the keyboard keeping up with the latest technology (or sneaking in a little flight or F1 simming). 
                Otherwise you can find me exploring the great outdoors by foot, small plane or even kayak. My wife and I live in Chicago, although 
                we've been known to disappear South when the sun goes into hiding.
